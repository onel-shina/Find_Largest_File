# Java code for finding the largest file:
#### This program uses Depth First Search to list all files within a directory and its subdirectories. Then, it iterates through the list and finds the largest file and shows its path and size in bytes.

------------

###### I also used Breadth First Search Algorithm in my test code.

##### This picture shows how Breadth First Search and Depth First Search algorithms work and the difference between them.

------------

### Example of the output this Java code will produce:
```
Starting at : /home/onel, the largest file was found here:
/home/onel/python/python/JPMC-tech-task-2-PY3/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/linux-686378/chrome-linux/chrome
 its size is: 234914136 bytes
 ```

##### My repository contains two approaches to this problem:
###### Main approach is in: LargestFile.java file (Faster running time)
###### Alternative approach is in: LargestFile2.java file (A little bit slower running time)
